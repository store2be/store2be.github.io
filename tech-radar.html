<p>
  Its purpose is to provide a platform to share knowledge and experience in
  technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our
  technology landscape. Based on the
  <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
    >pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a
  >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are interesting in
  software development &mdash; changes that we think our engineering teams
  should pay attention to and consider using in their projects.

  <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
  <p>
    The store2be Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an
    assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with
    the following semantics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to
      serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture
      in our store2be production environment, low risk and recommended to be
      widely used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with
      success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage
      experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
      technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization
      walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have
      clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some
      research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
      technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly
      unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have
      knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that
      have started a prototyping effort.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>RETIRE/LEGACY</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be
      used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not worth to further
      invest in. RETIRE/LEGACY technologies should not be used for new projects,
      but usually can be continued for existing projects.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

  <p>
    The Tech Radar is maintained by the whole
    <em>store2be engineering team</em>. Assignment of technologies to rings is
    the outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on
    store2be tech discussions. The Tech Radar depends on active participation
    and input from all engineering members at store2be.
